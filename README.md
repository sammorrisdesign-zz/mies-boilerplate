Mies Boilerplate
================

Mies Boilerplate is a project boilerplate for the web. It was designed so I could spend less time setting up projects and more time actually working on them, maybe you'll get some use out of it too.

## Usage

Initial install to get dependencies; `bundle install` and `npm install`. Then use `Grunt` to watch and lint the sass.

## Background

The project is named after the architect, [Ludwig Mies van der Rohe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe), who was one of the pioneers of modernism. It seemed appropriate for a project boilerplate when GitHub wanted a name from me.
